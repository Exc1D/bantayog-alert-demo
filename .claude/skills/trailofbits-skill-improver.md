# Skill Improvement Methodology

Iteratively improve a Claude Code skill using the skill-reviewer agent until it meets quality standards.

## Prerequisites

Requires the `plugin-dev` plugin which provides the `skill-reviewer` agent.

Verify it's enabled: run `/plugins` — `plugin-dev` should appear in the list.

## Core Loop

1. **Review** - Call skill-reviewer on the target skill
2. **Categorize** - Parse issues by severity
3. **Fix** - Address critical and major issues
4. **Evaluate** - Check minor issues for validity before fixing
5. **Repeat** - Continue until quality bar is met

## When to Use

- Improving a skill with multiple quality issues
- Iterating on a new skill until it meets standards
- Automated fix-review cycles instead of manual editing
- Consistent quality enforcement across skills

## When NOT to Use

- **One-time review**: Use `/skill-reviewer` directly instead
- **Quick single fixes**: Edit the file directly
- **Non-skill files**: Only works on SKILL.md files
- **Experimental skills**: Manual iteration gives more control during exploration

## Issue Categorization

### Critical Issues (MUST fix immediately)

- Missing required frontmatter fields (name, description) — Claude cannot index or trigger the skill
- Invalid YAML frontmatter syntax — Parsing fails, skill won't load
- Referenced files that don't exist — Runtime errors when Claude follows links
- Broken file paths — Same as above, leads to tool failures

### Major Issues (MUST fix)

- Weak or vague trigger descriptions — Claude may not recognize when to use the skill
- Wrong writing voice (second person "you" instead of imperative) — Inconsistent with Claude's execution model
- SKILL.md exceeds 500 lines without using references/ — Overloads context, reduces comprehension
- Missing "When to Use" or "When NOT to Use" sections — Required by project quality standards
- Description doesn't specify when to trigger — Skill may never be selected

### Minor Issues (Evaluate before fixing)

These are polish items that may or may not improve the skill:

- Subjective style preferences — Reviewer may have different taste than author
- Optional enhancements — May add complexity without proportional value
- "Nice to have" improvements — Consider cost-benefit before implementing
- Formatting suggestions — Often valid but low impact

## Minor Issue Evaluation

Before implementing any minor issue fix, evaluate:

1. **Is this a genuine improvement?** - Does it add real value or just satisfy a preference?
2. **Could this be a false positive?** - Is the reviewer misunderstanding context?
3. **Would this actually help Claude use the skill?** - Focus on functional improvements

## Completion Criteria

**CRITICAL**: Output this marker when done:

```
<skill-improvement-complete>
```

**When to output the marker:**

1. **skill-reviewer reports "Pass"** or **no issues found** → output marker immediately
2. **All critical and major issues are fixed** AND you've verified the fixes → output marker
3. **Remaining issues are only minor** AND you've evaluated them as false positives or not worth fixing → output marker

**When NOT to output the marker:**

- Any critical issue remains unfixed
- Any major issue remains unfixed
- You haven't run skill-reviewer to verify your fixes worked
